This weeks post is on Natural Language Processing, a computer science field that is now closely linked into the Data Science and Machine Learning worlds, especially since the explosion of AI.

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing is the concept of analysing natural language, wether thats text, speech or whatever, and giving it some meaning specifically to aid with human and computer interaction.

*So what does all that mean?*

Essentially, it is trying to quantify grammers, words or phrases so that word types, relationships and even sentiment can be identified. 

The Stanford NLP team have done some great work within this area and have produced some fantastic products that give you as a developer, data scientist or <insert job title of the month here> the ability to extract meaning from human language, programatically!

I used the Stanford Core NLP recently to analyse technology papers from the internet to pull out contextual information such as peoples names mentioned in the document, companies and even monetary values and indexed them within Elasticsearch along with the original document. This then allowed a comprehensive search suite giving contextual information back with each document.

### How Does it Work?

I'm going to base all my examples from the Stanford CoreNLP application. This is not only because I am familiar with it but also because it is really simple to use!

To give you a visual idea of how it works, I've taken the following image from the Stanford Core NLP page.

Looking at the Named Entity Recognition section, it shows parts of the sentence that it has identified and *tagged*.  From this you can see how easy it would be to obtain people, companies and locations from this text.

It is obviously more advanced than just picking out names. The Basic Dependencies image shows how the application links all the words together to give a really rich description of the grammar of the scentence. 


### How can I start to use it?

Start by [downloading the CoreNLP application](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/#download).
