![SAS Forum UK 2016 Birmingham](../)

SAS Forum UK 2016 is being held at the Vox Conference Centre in Birmingham. 

The day opened with an introduction into Viya and its capabilities before moving onto SAS customers discussing use cases. In the afternoon the conference hosted a number of 30 minute sessions across a number of streams including customer stories, SAS hosted talks and Technical talks. 

This post will share my thoughts on each of the sessions I attended as a Data Engineer and budding Data Scientist that has heard of, but never used SAS. I will be focusing on the capabilities that SAS tools can leverage and what they mean to Data Engineers and Scientists.

## Keynote: SAS Viya

The event comes a few days after the first release of SAS Viya: The new SAS open analytics platform. Viya has been the talk of the conference as it promotes not only a new platform but also a new direction for SAS. The main point being stressed around Viya is that it is **open**. This means that analytics capabilities will be opened up through API's that can be used in Python and Java. **Open** also refers to the platforms that Viya can be deployed on, including **Cloud based** infrastructures.
