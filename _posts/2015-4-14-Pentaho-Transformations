title: Pentaho Transformations
---

A **Transformation** is a connection of steps that allow **ETL** processes to take place on top of data.

It allows rows to be input from a number of input sources, transformed and then output to a number of output sources (anything from text files to Oracle Databases).
*Steps* within a transformation are connected by **Hop**s which are one way channels demonstrating the flow of data.

Below is an example of a transformation with two steps and a hop.
