title: Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN)
---

## Resource Manager
YARN is a master - worker architecture framework. 
The master role is played by the *Resource Manager(RM)* that manages the resources on workers and also schedules work in the cluster.
The **RM** is split into two components: the Scheduler and the Applications Manager. The scheduler orchestrates the running of jobs and can be configured in various ways - from FIFO so the first applications published are the first ones executed - to the Fair Scheduler which distributes the applications evenly.

## Application Manager
The work role is undertaken by the *Application Manager*, this manages the application lifecycle (an application is equivilent to something like a single MapReduce Job) and negotiates resources with the Resource Manager. It also utilises another aspect of the framework called the Node Manager to execute applications.
The AM starts application masters and monitoers and restarts these on different nodes when they fail (similair to the JobTracker). There is one AM per job and each job is split into tasks that run within a container on each node. A container is comparable to a MapReduce slot and once they are submitted to a node they can tell the Node manager to start jobs using the RM's scheduler.

Instead of **static resource allocation** - that is having a predefined number of map and reduce slots per node. Resource are requested dynamically in form of containers - resources can be RAM, CPU, bandwidth etc.

## Node Manager
A *Node Manager* lives on every node and it manages the user processes on that node. It allows long running services to be published to the node that can be configured to run from startup - ideal for long running services such as the MapReduce shuffle application, instead of this being managed by the TaskTracker.
